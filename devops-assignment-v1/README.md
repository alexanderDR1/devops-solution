description- Next to each task I did I wrote down a short description and the number of the task I did.
Now I presented each task what I did in the task and other thoughts that were.

Task 1) In this task I did not see some problems had identical templates and just had to connect them.

Task 2) An interesting and challenging task. By and large the result is to do a loop like FOR_EACH or even COUNT. But also very similar to uses in software languages ​​where there is a class, structure, array ...
I probably did not build the synstax so right but that's the direction.

Task 3) I gave a general FRONTED PORT that is open to any other port.

Task 4) What's nice about K8S is that you can set the amount of resources per container and that way you can prevent a system crash.

5) Here too the K8S brings with it the ability to do AUTOSCALE very simply.

6) Instead of changing the variables I did my side demo of the MULTI ENV

7) I used DATA to encrypt information.
In addition it is possible to make ENCODED64
And it is possible for better protection to use something.tfvar

In conclusion: I had fun doing the tasks, thank you for the opportunity and I will be happy to explain to you in depth what I thought and did and also learn from the mistakes
